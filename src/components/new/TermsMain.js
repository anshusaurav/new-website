                    incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. Fees for the Services may be payable in
                    advance, in arrears, per user, or as otherwise described on the Pricing Page or on an executed
                    Order Form or Statement of Work between us. You agree to pay Thunderpod the fees indicated for the

                    Fees for subscription-based Services will be invoiced to you or charged to your Payment Method on
                    the day your Services plan selection goes into effect and will cover fees for your Services plan
                    selection for the payment period indicated. Fees for other Services will be charged according to
                    the applicable Pricing Page, Order Form or Statement of Work. At the end of the indicated
                    Subscription Term for subscription-based Services, and unless otherwise set forth in the
                    applicable Order Form or Statement of Work, your purchased Services will automatically renew for
                    successive renewal Subscription Terms of equal length to the initial Subscription Term and the
                    applicable fees will continue to be invoiced to you or charged to your Payment Method on a
                    recurring basis until you change your Services plan selection or terminate this Agreement. The
                    amount of the charge for each renewal Subscription Term will be the then-current fee applicable to
                    the Services plan and Subscription Term you selected as set forth on the Pricing Page or otherwise
                    communicated to you. You acknowledge that the amount of the charge may increase if the applicable
                    fee increases. If applicable, you hereby authorize Thunderpod to charge your Payment Method for
                    such recurring charges.

                    You may upgrade, downgrade or terminate your Subscription Services plan selection at any time.
                    Plan downgrades and terminations will take effect only at the end of your current term and must be
                    made at least 30 days prior to the start of your next renewal Subscription Term in order to avoid
                    billing of the next renewal Subscription Term’s fees at the prior rate. Services upgrades will
                    take effect immediately and you will be charged a prorated fee for the remainder of your current
                    Subscription Term based on the difference in price between your current plan and the upgraded

                Payment Method. Thunderpod may, from time to time, offer various expedited payment methods, including
                payment by credit card, debit card, or direct debit. If you select such a payment method when purchasing
                the Services or provide such a payment method on an Order Form or Statement of Work (the “Payment
                Method”), you authorize Thunderpod to charge you for Services through such Payment Method and agree to
                make payment using such Payment Method and to keep your payment-related information up to date. Certain
                Payment Methods, such as credit cards and debit cards, may involve agreements between you and the
                financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Methods (the “Payment
                Method Provider”). If Thunderpod does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree
                to directly pay all amounts due upon demand from Thunderpod. Your non-termination or continued use of
                the Services reaffirms that Thunderpod is authorized to charge your Payment Method.

                Payment Matters. If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, Thunderpod reserves the right
                to either suspend or terminate your use of the Services. If Thunderpod has agreed to issue invoices to
                you, payment of all invoices is due within 14 days of invoice receipt. You agree to submit in writing to
                Thunderpod any disputes regarding any fees invoiced to you within 14 days of invoice receipt or charged
                to your Payment Method within 60 days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such
                invoices and charges will be final and not subject to challenge. Thunderpod reserves the right to charge
                you interest at a rate of 1.5% per month on any overdue amounts, or the maximum rate permitted by
                applicable law, whichever is lower. You will also reimburse any reasonable costs and expenses (including
                reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Thunderpod to collect any undisputed amount that is not paid
                when due. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for any partially
                used Services except (i) as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Pricing Page or an executed Order
                Form or Statement of Work between us; (ii) as otherwise required by applicable law; or (ii) at our sole
                and absolute discretion. All fees for Services are subject to change without notice; however, Thunderpod
                will use reasonable efforts to notify you at least 30 days before any fee increase and fee changes will
                not take effect until your next renewal.

                Definition. <b>"Confidential Information"</b> means non-public business information, know-how, and trade
                secrets in any form, including information regarding our product plans, security practices and policies,
                and any other information a reasonable person should understand to be confidential, which is disclosed
                by or on behalf of either party or its affiliates to the other party or its affiliates, directly or
                indirectly, in writing, orally, or by inspection of tangible objects, and whether such information is
                disclosed before or after the effective date of this Agreement. Confidential Information includes any
                portion of this Agreement and its terms that is not publicly available on our website. <b>"Confidential
                Information"</b> excludes information that (i) is publicly known and made generally available in the
                public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party through no action or inaction of
                the receiving party; (ii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure
                by the disclosing party, as shown by the receiving party’s files and records; or (iii) is obtained by
                the receiving party from a third party without a breach of the third party’s obligations of

                Maintenance of Confidentiality. The party receiving Confidential Information hereunder agrees to take
                reasonable steps, at least substantially equivalent to the steps it takes to protect its own proprietary
                information, but not less than reasonable care, to prevent the unauthorized duplication or disclosure of
                the Confidential Information to third parties without the disclosing party’s prior written consent. The
                receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to the receiving party’s
                employees or agents who reasonably need to have access to such information to perform the receiving
                party’s obligations under this Agreement, and who will treat such information as Confidential
                Information under the terms of this Agreement. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s
                Confidential Information if required by law so long as the receiving party gives the disclosing party
                written notice of the requirement prior to the disclosure (where permitted) and reasonable assistance,
                at the disclosing party’s expense, in limiting disclosure or obtaining an order protecting the
                information from public disclosure.

                event upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party will return to the
                disclosing party or destroy all materials, in any medium, to the extent containing or reflecting any of
                the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. With respect to your Customer Content, we will make
